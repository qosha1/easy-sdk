## Data Models

import DynamicTypeLoader from '@site/src/components/DynamicTypeLoader';

<DynamicTypeLoader 
  appName="products"
  title="Products App Data Models"
  showAllVariants={false}
/>

### Model Summary

The Products app includes the following serializers:
- **CategorySerializer**: 2 fields
- **BrandSerializer**: 1 fields  
- **ProductImageSerializer**: 0 fields
- **ProductListSerializer**: 6 fields
- **ProductDetailSerializer**: 10 fields
- **ProductCreateUpdateSerializer**: 1 fields
- **ProductSearchSerializer**: 9 fields

### ðŸŽ¯ Why Multiple Languages & Naming Conventions?

Different development environments have different conventions:

- **Frontend Teams**: Often prefer `camelCase` properties for JavaScript/TypeScript
- **Backend Teams**: May prefer `snake_case` to match Python/Django conventions  
- **Mobile Teams**: iOS uses `PascalCase`, Android varies by language
- **Integration Teams**: Need to match existing codebases and style guides

Easy-SDK generates **all variants automatically** so every team can use their preferred style without manual conversion.

## Filtering and Search

### Query Parameters

- `search` - Text search across name, description, SKU
- `category` - Filter by category ID
- `brand` - Filter by brand ID  
- `price__gte` - Minimum price filter
- `price__lte` - Maximum price filter
- `featured` - Filter featured products
- `status` - Filter by status (active, inactive, draft)
- `ordering` - Sort by fields (name, price, created_at, etc.)

### Example Requests

```bash

GET /api/products/?featured=true

# Search for products
GET /api/products/?search=wireless&category=1

# Get products on sale under $100
