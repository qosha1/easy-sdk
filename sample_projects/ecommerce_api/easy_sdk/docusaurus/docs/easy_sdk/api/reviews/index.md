## Data Models

import DynamicTypeLoader from '@site/src/components/DynamicTypeLoader';

<DynamicTypeLoader 
  appName="reviews"
  title="Reviews App Data Models"
  showAllVariants={false}
/>

### Model Summary

The Reviews app includes the following serializers:
- **ReviewSerializer**: 2 fields
- **ReviewListSerializer**: 1 fields
- **ReviewResponseSerializer**: 1 fields  
- **ReviewHelpfulSerializer**: 1 fields
- **ProductRatingSerializer**: 2 fields
- **ReviewCreateSerializer**: 0 fields

### ðŸŽ¯ Why Multiple Languages & Naming Conventions?

Different development environments have different conventions:

- **Frontend Teams**: Often prefer `camelCase` properties for JavaScript/TypeScript
- **Backend Teams**: May prefer `snake_case` to match Python/Django conventions  
- **Mobile Teams**: iOS uses `PascalCase`, Android varies by language
- **Integration Teams**: Need to match existing codebases and style guides

Easy-SDK generates **all variants automatically** so every team can use their preferred style without manual conversion.

## Review Creation Flow

### Submit a Review

```bash
POST /api/reviews/
Content-Type: application/json
Authorization: Token your-token-here

{
  "product": 1,
  "order": 5,  // Optional - links to purchase order
  "rating": 5,
  "title": "Amazing product!",
  "comment": "This product exceeded my expectations. Great quality and fast shipping."
}
```

```

## Filtering and Search

### Query Parameters

## Review Moderation

### Review States

- **Draft** - Review created but not yet approved
- **Approved** - Review is visible to public
- **Rejected** - Review was rejected by moderator

### Approval Workflow

2. Review starts as `is_approved=True` by default (auto-approval)
3. Admin can manually approve/reject reviews
4. Rejected reviews are hidden from public view
5. Product rating stats update automatically

### Admin Actions

```bash
# Approve a review
PATCH /api/reviews/12/approve/
Authorization: Token admin-token-here

# Reject a review
PATCH /api/reviews/12/reject/
Authorization: Token admin-token-here
